                Now keep in mind that everyone is different and that you do not have to do everything in this 9 step plan. You may not even

                appreciate you making it to the end though. Thanks a bunch. For those who are trying, please take this into consideration.
                Thank you and have a "FANTASICALEXCELENTE" day!
