                It's very simple and easy to just believe in oneself, so why is it so hard for people to do it. Could just be a lack of
                motivation, a lack of self-confidence, or a lack of self-respect. Could even be a combination of all 3. If
                you suffer from this issue, I want to help. Through this flipbook I'll do just that; I will help you believe
                in yourself.
